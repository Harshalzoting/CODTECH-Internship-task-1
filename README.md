**Overview of the project**

This project aims to develop a password strength assessment tool using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). Password security is a critical aspect of cybersecurity, and users often struggle to create strong passwords that are both memorable and secure. This tool will help users understand the strength of their passwords by analyzing factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness, and providing actionable feedback to improve password security.

**Key Components**:

Length Password length is a crucial determinant of password strength. Generally, longer passwords are more secure because they have a higher number of possible combinations, making them harder to crack. The tool will evaluate the length of the password and provide feedback if it is too short.

Complexity Complexity refers to the inclusion of various character types in the password:

1.Lowercase Letters: Including lowercase letters (a-z) adds to the complexity.

2.Uppercase Letters: Using uppercase letters (A-Z) further increases password strength. 

3.Numbers: Incorporating digits (0-9) makes the password more robust. 

4.Special Characters: Special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $, etc.) significantly enhance password complexity. 

The tool will check for the presence of these different character types and score the password based on its complexity.
Uniqueness Passwords should be unique and not easily guessable. Common passwords are a significant security risk as they are often the first targets of brute force attacks. The tool will compare the entered password against a list of common passwords and provide feedback if the password is found to be too common.

**Tool Features** 

Graphical User Interface (GUI): The tool will use Tkinter to create a user-friendly interface where users can enter their passwords.

Real-time Feedback: Upon entering a password and clicking a button, users will receive immediate feedback on the strength of their password.

Detailed Analysis: The tool will analyze the password's length, complexity, and uniqueness, providing a comprehensive assessment. 

Actionable Recommendations: The feedback will include specific suggestions for improving password strength, such as adding more characters, including uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters, and avoiding common passwords.
